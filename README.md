# 11-Data-Collection
 HTML Scraping
The Module 11 Challenge involved web scraping information about Mars.  The first deliverable asked us to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The second deliverable had us analyze weather data in a table for Mars.

I completed this homework using the following resources:
1) class zoom recordings
2) activites related to Module 11 class activities
3) prior class activities to review concepts for the data analysis
4) two classmates for assistance with the code on the final step of deliverable 2
5) Xpert Learning Assistance and Chatgpt
